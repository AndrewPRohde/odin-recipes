    <h2>Lord Eshteross' Maple Ginger Cookies with Turmeric</h2>
    <p>In our travels, word reached us of an accomplished amateur baker among the Jrusarian nobility. Lord Ariks
        Eshteross, though he was surprised to hear from us, proved to be a gracious host* and an enthusiastic
        instructor. Of his creations to date, he is proudest of these maple ginger cookies. He would like us to pass
        along to you that the longer you mix the dough after adding the egg and maple syrup, the more lovely crackles
        the cookies will develop as they bake. He also implores you not to skip the chilling step, as warm dough will
        spread too much on the baking sheets.

            kitchen had been disarmed.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup turbinado sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, and salt.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and brown sugar.
            (Alternatively, use a large mixing bowl and electric handheld mixer.) Beat on medium speed, scraping the
            sides of the bowl halfway through, until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the
            egg and maple syrup. Mix on medium speed until fluffy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer
            running on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture, beating just until combined and a soft dough forms, 1
            to 2 minutes. Wrap the mixing bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Set 2 oven racks at the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat the oven to 350°F / 175°C. Line
            3 baking sheets (or as many as you have) with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats. Place the turbinado
            sugar in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a 1 1/2-inch / 4cm cookie scoop (or 2 rounded tablespoons), portion out the dough and roll into balls.
            Roll the balls in the turbinado sugar and place at least 3 inches / 7.5cm apart on the prepared baking
            sheets (6 per tray).</li>
        <li>Bake two pans at the same time, swapping the top sheet to the bottom rack and bottom sheet to the top midway
            through baking, until the tops crack and the cookies are lightly browned around the edges, 13 to 14 minutes.
            Bake the remaining tray on either rack. (If reusing one of the baking sheets, let it cool for at least 15
            minutes before reusing.) Let cool completely on the baking sheets.</li>
    </ol>
