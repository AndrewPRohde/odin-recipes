    <h2>Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <p>These cookies are a delicious, chewy, chocalatey, dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces unsalted butter</li>
        <li>12 ounces white flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking sode</li>
        <li>2 ounces granulated sugar</li>
        <li>8 ounces brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 ounce whole milk (or milk substitute)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate. Pour the butter into your stand mixer's
            work bowl. Add the sugar and brown sugar and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together the whole egg, the egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract in a measuring cup. Reduce
            the mixer speed and slowly add the egg mixture. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping a couple of times to
            scrape down the sides of the bowl. Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to "stir" and add the
            chocolate chips. Chill the dough for 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and place racks in the top third and bottom third of the oven.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment-lined half sheet pans, 6 cookies per sheet. Bake 2
            sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Remove from the oven, slide the
            parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack and wait at least 5 minutes before devouring.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The darker the sugar you use, the chewier the cookies will be.</p>
